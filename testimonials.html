She has a methodical approach to onboarding moms and a structure to her classes. I particularly love that she is one of the few centres that does physical classes and it’s always great to be a part of the community she is building!

                    My partner and I attended Shree’s labour management workshop and found her breathing techniques, information, resources, emphasis on partner support really useful . The class was fun and engaging! Keep going, Shree!<span class="double-inverted-comma">&#8221;</span></p>

Shree's expertise and compassionate approach created a supportive environment, making the classes both informative and enjoyable. Her dedication in sharing valuable insights, coupled with practical tips, not only eased my pregnancy journey but also made it more enriching.

Additionally, my partner and I found the labor workshop, led by Shree, incredibly insightful, empowering us with knowledge about the various stages of labor. I wholeheartedly recommend Aura's prenatal classes, especially with Shree at the helm, for a comprehensive and empowering journey through pregnancy and childbirth.<span class="double-inverted-comma">&#8221;</span></p>

I want to give a shout-out to this wonderful lady Shree who is doing a fantastic job and helping all would be moms in every step. Shree I owe you a big thank you for guiding me throughout my pregnancy ❤️
                    Little bit about my journey - I have started taking these sessions in my 7th month ( I had this regret that I should have joined earlier but it’s fine all's well That ends well) and like every other lady even I wanted to have a vaginal birth. Daily sessions were a calming routine for me and I appreciate her support, guidance and motivation to help prepare me for birthing process. Her breathing exercises were extremely helpful in keeping me calm during my 18 hours of labour pain. And yes she also paid close attention to every moms and modify the exercise as per every individual’s need. She was there with me on call whenever I needed in my labour pain. She guided me to do few exercises like squats, malasan, walking and breathing during my active labour time and I had a smooth normal delivery. <span class="double-inverted-comma">&#8221;</span></p>

Her workouts are incredibly beneficial, leaving you feeling energized after each session. Shree not only prepares you for labor and postpartum with her engaging workouts and daily talks but also ensures that your fitness routine aligns with your doctor's recommendations. I also participated in the labor management workshop with my husband, and although he gained valuable insights, most of the information was already covered in our classes for moms. Shree is exceptionally kind and always ready to address any doubts or concerns about pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. My experience at Aura has been nothing short of amazing, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to all expecting mothers.<span class="double-inverted-comma">&#8221;</span></p>

The sessions were well planned, timed and arranged. As first time parents, we were unaware of so many points and information until we attended the session. We felt comfortable and not judged for any type of question we had, hence by the end of the session, we were equipped with so much knowledge. We are very much confident and comfortable with our labour process. The takeaways we had from the session was something we will cherish and hold on for a lifetime. Shree, as the meeting host brings in the positive energy and enthusiasm throughout the session. Do attend the session held by Shree and excited to join in for other sessions, in the future as well.<span class="double-inverted-comma">&#8221;</span></p>
